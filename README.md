# Delivery-Time-Estimation-Model-Cassandra-2023
Certainly! Let's go through the project in detail:

### Project Overview:
The goal of the project is to estimate delivery times based on various features provided in the dataset. The project follows a typical machine learning workflow, consisting of data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction on new data.

### 1. Data Loading:
The project starts by loading the training and test datasets using the `load_data` function. The training data includes features such as 'od_start_time', 'od_end_time', 'trip_creation_time', and others, with the target variable being 'actual_time', representing the actual delivery time.

### 2. Data Preprocessing:
The `preprocess_data` function handles various preprocessing tasks:

   - **Handling Missing Values:** It fills missing values in the 'trip_creation_time' column with the corresponding values from 'od_start_time'.

   - **Datetime Conversion:** The relevant columns ('od_start_time', 'od_end_time', 'trip_creation_time') are converted to datetime format.

   - **Feature Engineering:** Additional features are created based on datetime differences, such as 'total_od_time', 'creation_to_start', and 'creation_to_end'.

   - **Categorical Encoding:** Categorical features are encoded using `LabelEncoder`. The categorical columns include 'route_type', 'is_cutoff', 'source_center', 'destination_center', 'route_schedule_uuid', 'source_name', and 'destination_name'.

   - **Handling Missing Values (Continued):** The 'pad' method is used to fill missing values in the dataset.

### 3. Data Splitting:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the `split_data` function. This function returns features (`X_train`, `X_test`) and target variables (`y_train`, `y_test`).

### 4. Model Training:
The `train_models` function initializes and trains machine learning models on the training data. In this case, it uses a Random Forest Regressor and a CatBoost Regressor. These models are stored in the `ensemble` list.

### 5. Model Evaluation:
The `evaluate_models` function assesses the performance of the ensemble on the test set using the R-squared metric.

### 6. Prediction on New Data:
The `make_predictions` function takes the trained ensemble models and a new dataset (test data in this case), scales the features, makes predictions, and saves the results to a CSV file.

### 7. Main Function:
The `main` function orchestrates the entire workflow. It loads and preprocesses the training data, splits it, trains the models, evaluates their performance, and finally makes predictions on the test data.

### 8. Execution:
The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ensures that the `main` function is executed when the script is run.

### Conclusion:
This project follows a structured approach to delivery time estimation. It includes proper data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps. The use of ensemble models (Random Forest and CatBoost) is a good practice for improving predictive performance. Additionally, the project provides a foundation for future enhancements, such as hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, or the incorporation of additional features for further improvement.
